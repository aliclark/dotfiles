These files can be symlinked or copied to the home directory.

The shell script `install` copies the files across, deleting anything in its path.

Only run `install` from within the dotfiles directory once you have moved it to where you wish.
The script creates links for any files with an extension, so eg "./a.b" will be linked from "~/.a"
