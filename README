These files can be symlinked to from the home directory.

The bash script `install-dotlinks` does this automatically for each file.

Only run `install-dotlinks` from within the dotfiles directory once you have moved it to where you wish.
The script creates links for any files with an extension, so eg "./a.b" will be linked from "~/.a"

The script appends any existing files with ".backup",
potentially overwriting an existing file with that name.
